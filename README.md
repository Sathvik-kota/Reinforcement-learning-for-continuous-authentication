# Reinforcement-learning-for-continuous-authentication  
Authentication can be broadly classified into two types: static (one-time) authentication and
continuous authentication .   
Static authentication typically involves the use of a password or
multi-factor authentication methods, where users enter their credentials at the time of logging
in to the system, and the verification happens in the backend database  
Continuous authentication, on the other hand, estimates the likelihood that the user accessing the system throughout the session
is the same user who initially claimed to be. This is done by analysing the user’s behaviour,
such as keystroke dynamics, without the need for external device  
The proposed model utilizes reinforcement learning techniques to identify and authenticate users , by continuously monitoring their behaviour.
# Objective
The main objective  of our project is to design and implement an accurate and comprehensive model for user authentication and identification using  keystroke dynamics. This involves analysing
typing, website activity, and mouse movements to ascertain the user’s presence .This can help to secure user accounts and can improve the security and privacy of online systems, as well as the user experience.
