# Reinforcement-learning-for-continuous-authentication  
Authentication can be broadly classified into two types: static (one-time) authentication and
continuous authentication .   
Static authentication typically involves the use of a password or
multi-factor authentication methods, where users enter their credentials at the time of logging
in to the system, and the verification happens in the backend database  
Continuous authentication, on the other hand, estimates the likelihood that the user accessing the system throughout the session
is the same user who initially claimed to be. This is done by analysing the user’s behaviour,
such as keystroke dynamics, without the need for external device  
The proposed model utilizes reinforcement learning techniques to identify and authenticate users , by continuously monitoring their behaviour.

# Objective
The main objective  of our project is to design and implement an accurate and comprehensive model for user authentication and identification using  keystroke dynamics. This involves analysing
typing, website activity, and mouse movements to ascertain the user’s presence .This can help to secure user accounts and can improve the security and privacy of online systems, as well as the user experience.     
# Reinforcement Learning 
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that focuses on training models to make decisions in an uncertain environment . Reinforcement learning (RL) in behavioral biometrics trains models to authenticate users based on typing dynamics, mouse movements, and other patterns. The RL agent learns by receiving rewards for correct identifications and penalties for errors, improving its accuracy over time. A key advantage is its ability to adapt dynamically to changes in user behavior without requiring active participation, enhancing both security and user experience.

# Dataset 
**Dataset-1:-** The BBMAS (Behavioral Biometrics Multidevice Active Authentication System) dataset is a public dataset designed for research in behavioral biometrics .  It is a collection of keystroke
data from multiple users performing various activities on different devices .
