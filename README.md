# Reinforcement-learning-for-continuous-authentication  
Authentication can be broadly classified into two types: static (one-time) authentication and
continuous authentication .   
Static authentication typically involves the use of a password or
multi-factor authentication methods, where users enter their credentials at the time of logging
in to the system, and the verification happens in the backend database  
Continuous authentication, on the other hand, estimates the likelihood that the user accessing the system throughout the session
is the same user who initially claimed to be. This is done by analysing the userâ€™s behaviour,
such as keystroke dynamics, without the need for external device  
The proposed model utilizes reinforcement learning techniques to identify and authenticate users , by continuously monitoring their behaviour.
